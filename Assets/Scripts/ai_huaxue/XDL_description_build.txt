XDL files will follow XML syntax and consist of three mandatory sections: 

Hardware, where virtual vessels and apparatus that the reaction mixture can reside in are declared.  

Reagents, where all reagents that are used in the procedure are declared.  

Procedure, where all experimental actions are defined, is organized into two stages: the first involves hardware manipulation, in which the experimental setup is assembled and secured using actions such as Attach or Assemble; the second involves experimental operations, where chemical or physical actions such as Add, Heat, or Transfer are performed. This structured sequence ensures that the setup is fully constructed before any experimental operations are executed.

Hardware:
Each individual reagent, unless otherwise stated should be contained within their own components. The Hardware section should only contain Component tags.

(format is(Property, Type, Description))

id, str, Name of hardware

contains, reagent, Reagent contained in the vessel before any operation. Generally empty unless it is certain that the reagent is initially present.

Reagents:
The Reagents section contains Reagent elements with the props below.
Any reagents which were combined before the experiment should be combined as one reagent before the procedure. (i.e. 'lime juice mixed with sugar' = <Reagent name='lime juice mixed with sugar')

Reagent:
Reagent used by procedure.

(format is(Property, Type, Description))

name, str, Name of reagent

state, str, - State of the reagent (liquid or solid).

Procedure:
All steps included in the Full Steps Specification may be given within the Procedure block of a XDL file. 


Here is a list of tags that can be used in this language:
Hardware Manipulate: Attach, Insert
Reagents Manipulate: Add, Transfer
