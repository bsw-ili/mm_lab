We can first use test tube clamps to fix the test tube to the iron stand, and then add a small amount of marble shards to the test tube. Next, we seal the mouth of the test tube with a rubber stopper with a delivery tube, and insert one end of the delivery tube into a beaker containing clear limewater. Finally, we use a dropper to add an appropriate amount of dilute hydrochloric acid to the test tube and observe whether there is any change in the limewater at the end of the delivery tube. Teacher, why do we use clear limewater in this experiment?
